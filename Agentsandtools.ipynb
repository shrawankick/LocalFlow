They are designed to create and execute plans that maximize the expected value of this function upon completion. For example, a reinforcement learning agent has a reward function, which allows programmers to shape its desired behavior. Similarly, an evolutionary algorithm\\'s behavior is guided by a fitness function.\\nIntelligent agents in artificial intelligence are closely related to agents in economics, and versions of the intelligent agent paradigm are studied in cognitive science, ethics, and the philosophy of practical reason, as well as in many interdisciplinary socio-cognitive modeling and computer social simulations. Reactive agents are the simplest form of AI. Simple reflex agents operate based on predetermined rules and do not rely on complex decision-making processes. In modern implementations, more advanced agents can autonomously manage multi-step tasks, interact with other systems, and coordinate workflows across digital environments\\nIntelligent agents are often described schematically as abstract functional systems similar to computer programs. To distinguish theoretical models from real-world implementations, abstract descriptions of intelligent agents are called abstract intelligent agents.

It currently uses GPT-5.1, a generative pre-trained transformer (GPT), to generate text, speech, and images in response to user prompts. It is credited with accelerating the AI boom, an ongoing period marked by rapid investment and public attention toward the field of artificial intelligence (AI). OpenAI operates the service on a freemium model. Users can interact with ChatGPT through text, audio, and image prompts.\\nBy January 2023, ChatGPT had become the fastest-growing consumer software application in history, gaining over 100 million users in two months. As of 2025, ChatGPT\\'s website is among the top 5 most-visited websites globally, and has over 800 million active weekly users. It has been lauded as a revolutionary tool that could transform numerous professional fields. At the same time, its release prompted extensive media coverage and public debate about the nature of creativity and the future of knowledge work.\\nDespite its acclaim, the chatbot has been criticized for its limitations and potential for unethical use. It can generate plausible-sounding but incorrect or nonsensical answers known as hallucinations. Biases in its training data have been reflected in its responses. The chatbot can facilitate academic dishonesty, generate misinformation, and create malicious code. The ethics of its development, particularly the use of copyrighted content as training data, have also drawn controversy. These issues have led to its use being restricted in some workplaces and educational institutions and have prompted widespread calls for the regulation of artificial intelligence.\\n\\nPage: History of artificial intelligence\\nSummary: The history of artificial intelligence (AI) began in antiquity, with myths, stories, and rumors of artificial beings endowed with intelligence or consciousness by master craftsmen. The study of logic and formal reasoning from antiquity to the present led directly to the invention of the programmable digital computer in the 1940s, a machine based on abstract mathematical reasoning. This device and the ideas behind it inspired scientists to begin discussing the possibility of building an electronic brain.\\nThe field of AI research was founded at a workshop held on the campus of Dartmouth College in 1956. Attendees of the workshop became the leaders of AI research for decades. Many of them predicted that machines as intelligent as humans would exist within a generation. The U.S. government provided millions of dollars with the hope of making this vision come true.\\nEventually, it became obvious that researchers had grossly underestimated the difficulty of this feat. In 1974, criticism from James Lighthill and pressure from the U.S. Congress led the U.S. and British Governments to stop funding undirected research into artificial intelligence. Seven years later, a visionary initiative by the Japanese Government and the success of expert systems  reinvigorated investment in AI, and by the late 1980s, the industry had grown into a billion-dollar enterprise.
